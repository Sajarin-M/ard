## TypeScript/React Style

- Exports: use named exports only; no default exports.
- Declarations: use `function` for components/hooks/exported functions; use arrows only for callbacks/render props.
- Types: type exported/public APIs; avoid `any`; use `import type`/`export type`.
- Imports: follow Prettier sort and prefer `~` alias.
- React: Automatic JSX runtime; don't import `React` just for JSX.
