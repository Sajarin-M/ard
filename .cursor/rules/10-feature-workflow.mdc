## Feature workflow

- **Study before editing**. Read the existing features for the feature area to reuse shapes, names, and UX flows instead of inventing new ones.
- **Minimal diffs**. Touch only the files needed for the feature. Do not rename or reshuffle unrelated code, and never modify generated assets (e.g. `routeTree.gen.ts`).
